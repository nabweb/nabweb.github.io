            <div class="imagetext">
                <p>My name is Nabeel and I am currently a junior at the
                    University of California Berkeley studying Data Science. 
                    Coming into college, I had no prior coding experience but 
                    I quickly developed a passion for this new field as I
                    love finding patterns in data, creating visualizations 
                    and communicating stories about it. Today, I am a member
                    of the Machine Learning Club at Berkeley where I work on
                    various ML projects and help teach the foundations of 
                    ML to new members of the club.

                I was born and raised in Mauritius, a tiny island in the 
                Indian Ocean. Mauritius and Berkeley are different environments; 
                socially, culturally and academically but I am extremely happy 
                to have found a new home at Berkeley where I am always challenged 
                to think differently. Being a big foodie, I obviously miss my 
                favorite “dholl puris” snack from back home but I love cheesecake 
                just as much and I am always treating myself to a slice.
            </p>

            <p class='bottomparagraph'> In my free time, I am usually playing or watching soccer and 
                hanging out with friends. I support Manchester City, a club 
                in the English Premier League, and never miss any of their games. 
                I am also part of the Cal Fencing Club. I fell in love with the 
                sport since my freshman year because of its unique combination 
                of strategy and physicality and I practice twice per week. 
                Whenever I have longer breaks, I love bingewatching tv shows. Some of my favorites
                include Rick and Morty, Ozark, Stranger Things, Peaky Blinders, ATLA, or Black Mirror.
